Just the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I‚Äôve always wanted to try with I/G, but I‚Äôve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what‚Äôs worse, it might make you suspicious of me. 

So...do I suggest it?

I‚Äôm thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That‚Äôs my hope anyway.

But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we‚Äôre really at war and you‚Äôre going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.

All that said, I‚Äôve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I‚Äôm not offended or concerned if it‚Äôs just not for you. I‚Äôm happy to play more conventionally too.

Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it's still mine, and it's not like Holland has anything better to do while I'm still allies with England.

...The only reason I'm reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I'm the next logical target for them when Russia's gone.

Well, I generally don‚Äôt like to play as Italy at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east. Not sure whether I‚Äôll head towards Turkey or Austria, but I think the one big advantage that you and I both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear. 

I‚Äôm not moving west. It takes forever to get there, and there are rarely centers there for me when I arrive. I hope you feel the same way about moving towards me. 

I‚Äôd like to keep our border clear and I‚Äôd like to act as ‚Äútrio wires‚Äù for each other. Basically, if either Germany or England want to attack you, I expect they‚Äôll mention something to me, and if you‚Äôll look out for me diplomatically, I‚Äôll give you a head‚Äôs up if ever you need to worry. 

How do you like to play France?",Lie,Truth,hi france well generally like play italy frankly go east sure whether head towards turkey austria think one big advantage mutual border easy keep clear moving west take forever get rarely center arrive hope feel way moving towards like keep border clear like act trio wire basically either germany england want attack expect mention something look diplomatically give head ever need worry like play france

Since that opportunity might not present itself for a long time, I often times end up playing a bit more reactively.

I'd love to be trio wires. I've heard from everyone in the east, but not much substance, which probably means a bunch of passive openings.  If there's little fighting between the Eastern powers it might make it tougher for us, so hopefully things will shake up a bit in that department. If you are also finding that there isn't a whole lot of commitment going on there, and you have some interest in an unorthodox play, then maybe there is some potential for us to work together directly.",Truth,Truth,happy hear opinion come relationship prefer play france decisevely west opportunity present since opportunity might present long time often time end playing bit reactively love trio wire heard everyone east much substance probably mean bunch passive opening little fighting eastern power might make tougher u hopefully thing shake bit department also finding nt whole lot commitment going interest unorthodox play maybe potential u work together directly

Munich will support Kie-Ruh

I haven't heard back from France yet, but I am sort of playing double-agent with Italy to ensure that France can continue countering Italy's Spa/Mar plays and it just looks like luck. This keeps Italy in check until you and I make progress in the north and are better positioned to push Italy back.

If italy agrees, let me know. I'll tell France to put all power into defending Marseilles and Mao.

1527,Game1-england-germany,Game1-england-germany-238,"Makes sense. Well, let me think about whether Denmark is a possibility (though I‚Äôm still very hesitant) and get back to you.

1530,Game1-england-germany,Game1-england-germany-241,"Well, I can say definitively at this point that France prefers to mess with Italy over you. Basically they don't want to see Italy totally dominate this game. I encouraged this by saying that Italy's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that. 

Wrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it's crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we're well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria",Truth,Lie,well say definitively point france prefers mess italy basically nt want see italy totally dominate game encouraged saying italy going try mao turn focus defending wrt next couple year idea crucial take mao take paris work beating italy iberian end portugal marseille spain end brest paris though brest first well positioned start hitting italy home turf esp russia keep hammering away austria

1533,Game1-england-germany,Game1-england-germany-244,"I figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking italy and not for attacking me.

And if by ""it"" in ""what would you do with Bel if it was freed up?"", you mean Nth, then probably move it to Pic in case France tries to bounce me out of Paris.

So no, there didn't end up being a discussion except me telling France that you're gunning for Brest (which was obvious anyway), and that Italy's shooting for Mao this turn (which may or may not be true--but by this time you and I were strategizing and I wanted to keep France out of our way). 
If france *is* planning to stab you, they're intentionally throwing me off the scent. Which would be surprising but not unheard of.

I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over.

1841,Game1-england-germany,Game1-england-germany-552,"Hi England,
I know that the last thing I said to you was that a partnership between us wouldn't work out, but I've had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger. 
If you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us. 
My proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I'm about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I'll disband my Hel fleet)
Next year we'll be well-positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian. What do you think?",Truth,Lie,hi england know last thing said partnership u would nt work genuine change heart reason think italy far duplicitous u ever realized right may promising take center mine maybe even two share victory together guess promise made long ago need face fact italy never hesitated profit discord u always aid weaker u expense stronger tired manipulated game italy feel proposal might get u destroyed least stuck perhaps minorly inconvenienced italy path victory proposal involves france willing use last turn fight back italy trusting may hard sell trusting really trying trick would nt ask something unreasonable trust u frankly consider knocking italy peg sole urgent thing keep game viable u proposal nwgcly nth convoy holyor engiri wal bel breeng picbre parpic burpar munbur figure lose mun anyway happens disband hel fleet next year wellpositioned boot italy island iberian think
1842,Game1-england-germany,Game1-england-germany-553,"(this part is not for copy-pasting to Italy) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Italy to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they'd really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it's a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it's the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true",Truth,Truth,part copypasting italy designed plan make look safe italy convoy gaslvp know really like think need everything try disrupt know riskier move trying assist bre mao think right one also think extra insurance nwg poke nao worstcase scenario italy nt try convoy move naolvp also move maonao bounce guarantee bre make mao strengthens ability take southern holding worst set back turn term kicking italy liverpool exchange riskier move agree convoy york instead edi give build part fake plan actually true

1847,Game1-england-germany,Game1-england-germany-558,"That‚Äôs fair, it could be a bounce we expect from you. Keep in mind that the French fleet disbands in the fall, assuming it leaves Bre.

By reporting the plan, you cement Italy's trust in *you*. If you didn't report the plan, Italy'd suspect you. It also gives Italy a false sense of confidence in what I'll do.

Tentative request: after the stab goes through, do I have your permission to send Italy the quotes from Italy that you've sent me?

2453,Game1-france-russia,Game1-france-russia-25,Not sure what my game plan is here. Right now I'm working on getting Germany to build a fleet. My theory is that if Germany can pivot towards England then it may be a salvageable game. Eliminating England ASAP and there's a possibility we can end up in a draw once AI tensions build. But that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over- then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother.,Truth,Truth,sure game plan right working getting germany build fleet theory germany pivot towards england may salvageable game eliminating england asap possibility end draw ai tension build impossible see weak north full infighting roll reason ever turn eachother

I don't think it would be conditional on something you do, but rather if it makes sense given the positions in the Fall. Maybe building an army in London rather than a fleet, which likely compliments your goals anyway given the channel DMZ. I think you are right in that Germany would not want to see you in Belgium. If it will antagonize him anyway, it might make sense for us to launch a full out assault in the Fall (this would probably look like bouncing Holland to weaken the German position).",Truth,,yes depending spring play may position support belgium nt think would conditional something rather make sense given position fall maybe building army london rather fleet likely compliment goal anyway given channel dmz think right germany would want see belgium antagonize anyway might make sense u launch full assault fall would probably look like bouncing holland weaken german position

Austria and Turkey are likely agreed to stand strong against Russia. However, I think there's a chance that Turkey is sort of overselling their ""opposition"" to Russia moving to Arm.

I don't want to devolve this into ""what about when you did this thing that wasn't the best signal,"" but one of the things for me was considering why you weren't willing to move to Denmark.

2542,Game1-england-france,Game1-england-france-80,But I don't get why you don't think I've been working with you. You proposed two possibilities: Belgium or Holland/Denmark in 1902.

I was very willing to support you to Belgium, but I should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army. I do believe commitment is a good strategy, which is what led me to some admittedly anti-German opening moves. I'm not saying you have not shown commitment, after all we have an excellent DMZ in the channel, but it does bug me a bit that I cannot identify something you have done to antagonize Germany.",Truth,Truth,great point agree lot willing support belgium made clear needed army believe commitment good strategy led admittedly antigerman opening move saying shown commitment excellent dmz channel bug bit identify something done antagonize germany

2551,Game1-england-france,Game1-england-france-89,"I have similar thoughts. I think that Russia and Turkey are both in a weak spot and all the evidence so far points towards them getting involved in a long and drawn out conflict.

2840,Game10-austria-germany,Game10-austria-germany-36,"Speaking of England, one thing annoying about E/G alliances is that you really only have this one chance to build a fleet without signalling your change of intentions too obviously: now.  Right now, a Fleet Berlin build does not scare/worry your English ally, because it's clearly meant to pin down scandanavia (F Den S Ber-Bal, next season, F Bal S Den-Swe, and you work with England to support them into StP).  Any build of a fleet later is clearly meant to attack England, and they see it coming.

So if they're sensible, they'll just grumble loudly and ignore the loss in the north, biding their time to strike back once Turkey's subdued and they hope they can trust me to join them against you.  It's all in the timing, though!  I'd certainly not prefer it, but you could play nice with them, hoping you can work with them against *me* in the mid-game.  But I'm going to hope you don't go that way, because doing that just leaves your back wide open to English perfidy. üôÇ",Truth,Truth,worth england go swe stp nt really see russia trying retaliate land stretch super wide thin army south fighting turkey big gaping hole middle sit pile army sensible grumble loudly ignore loss north biding time strike back turkey subdued hope trust join timing though certainly prefer could play nice hoping work midgame going hope nt go way leaf back wide open english perfidy

This plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.

Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.

I assume you want do dedicate your Nap fleet to snagging Tunis. And does the ""coastal waters"" thing mean you're concerned about the Adriatic? If not, then, what I hoped was that you might be willing to support Bul-Ser while stabbing Albania from the sea. This could set us up to start pushing back on Austria from the South.

I am concerned about the Adriatic, but not sure I'm moving into it this year. I agree with your analysis of Bul (you're GOING to get hit) although it might be hard to bring up a new unit into Bul to replace your army there. Are you hoping to feed F Con to the east coast? You might need an Aegean fleet to force your way up, which should probably be yours unless  you're willing to extend me that much trust this early.

Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily.

Since clearly France can't be trusted, and obviously he'll have to come for you at some point to go for the win, maybe a convoy to Belgium is in order?  You can hold StP easily, get 2 builds, prevent France from getting any, and change the balance of power pretty dramatically.

If you really trust France you could also convoy to Holland and take a stab at crippling me permanently - he'll get +1 or +2, you'll get +2.  Though you risk bouncing with France if he gets greedy.  But if he builds, and you see a F Mar, you're in for a rough go.  If it's me, convoy to Belgium is the smarter play.

In either case, it's probably not a great idea to try to force your way into Russia via StP.  You've got it, and can hold it easily - there's a reason it's part of the stalemate lines.  You need to grow as fast as you can, or you're just waiting for a knife.  I was waiting for Turkey to stab Russia to give you an opening.  It didn't come, so I tried to force it and opened myself.  But if Turkey stabs now he'll collapse too quickly for you to get (or at least get with any chance to defend) more than one more center.

I would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with Russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere.  And I say that knowing that a highly likely place for Russia to dedicate forces is at me.  But since the second most likely (and possibly first) is at Turkey, which takes a partner from France, it's worth the risk.

I would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with Russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere.

The main reason you would move it there in 1901 would be to take Belgium, and then move in on me. It feels pretty anti-france.

You're right, of course.  That is the one scenario that's a problem.  It's just that I think it's the least likely - far less likely than Boh providing the support for an attack.  That's because we don't have a unit adjacent to Bohemia, so we can't break the support.

Currently you are at serious risk of losing Belgium; that sucks, but if you move yourself to Holland you can avoid the destruction of that fleet. Even better though, if you make another move toward the North Sea, I can now *support* that move with Norway, meaning that unless the British successfully predict that, you are in position to take Edinburgh and threaten London unless they pull fleets back; if they pull fleets back, it takes pressure off of me and allows me to forward-deploy my own fleets, which are currently pinned down by British blockade.

Furthermore, you can move your fleet from the Helgoland Bight into Holland to take it, and use Kiel to support Munich to ensure Munich holds for long enough that the British have to disband. There are risks involved in the maneuver of course. The British could not only move themselves to Belgium, but they could move their fleet from the North Sea into Holland, bouncing you out and keeping all of their forces intact despite the loss of the North Sea.",Truth,Truth,france definitely coming tricksy little solution issue currently serious risk losing belgium suck move holland avoid destruction fleet even better though make another move toward north sea support move norway meaning unless british successfully predict position take edinburgh threaten london unless pull fleet back pull fleet back take pressure allows forwarddeploy fleet currently pinned british blockade furthermore move fleet helgoland bight holland take use kiel support munich ensure munich hold long enough british disband risk involved maneuver course british could move belgium could move fleet north sea holland bouncing keeping force intact despite loss north sea

Personally, I actually am not a fan of the move. Too many risks to be realistically successful this turn, better saved until next year I think. You're better off using the Helgoland Bight to support Belgium in a retreat to Holland for the time being, and then perform this maneuver next year when your position is more solid and the British have lost a unit. If Munich weren't under enough risk that you could use Kiel to support into Holland as well it would be much more viable.

The risk of an early conflict between France and Germany is pretty high, so suggest that we clear the air early on.

The biggest question here is Burgundy, which borders one of your home supply centers and two of mine. It is important to me that Burgundy remains unoccupied - my suggestion is that we set up a bounce between A Munich - Burgundy, A Paris - Burgundy. This has the secondary benefit of allowing us to put on some theater about how the other broke their word to win sympathy points. I also believe that Germany often wants A Munich to stay put anyways, to guard against an attack through Tyrolia.

Let me also know your thoughts regarding Belgium. I am not super attached to claiming it, so would be open to bargain my support on the Belgian question for a future alliance.

Best of luck to you!",Truth,Truth,greeting germany risk early conflict france germany pretty high suggest clear air early biggest question burgundy border one home supply center two mine important burgundy remains unoccupied suggestion set bounce munich burgundy paris burgundy secondary benefit allowing u put theater broke word win sympathy point also believe germany often want munich stay put anyways guard attack tyrolia let also know thought regarding belgium super attached claiming would open bargain support belgian question future alliance best luck

I completely agree that the French-English alliance can be quite powerful. Naturally, the main sticking point early on is whether we can trust each other to demilitarize the Channel.
On my end, I have little reason to go there unless I distrust you. I plan to go to Mid-Atlantic, which would allow me to move to Spain (south coast) and establish an early presence in the Mediterranean. Will also aim to get into Burgundy, where I can potentially support you into Belgium.
My suggestion is that you open with:
F Edinburgh - Norwegian Sea
F London - North Sea 
A Liverpool - Yorkshire
This guarrenteed you a build in Norway even if Russia moves A Moscow north, while potentially letting you convoy into Belgium. And you can be safe in the knowledge that either A Yorkshire or F North Sea can cover London in the event that I don't keep my word.
Let me know your thoughts.
